Motivation
##########

Through one of the subjects in my Master's course, I carried on a project analyzing metrics of Software Models and visualizing it in APP4MC. 

It was quite challenging as I was not very familiar with Amalthea model and APP4MC platform at first. But soon I was able to understand the concepts and started enjoying it. 

The project resulted in completing an application delivering performance & reliability metric of the given Software Model. Which is basically my motivation for participating this Eclipse GSoC project, "CPU-GPU Response Time and Mapping Analysis".

Since this topicâ€™s ultimate goal is to achieve systems' Real-Time determinism with HPC(High Performance Computing), analyzing Response Time is essential and I think my basic knowledge of things like time constraints, End-to-End Event Chain Latencies according to the different communication paradigms (IC, LET) which I have gotten through the Master's study was very helpful for me to carry on this project.

Now that the industry's interest has moved on to "Heterogeneous Systems", I do hope that my GSoC project will be helpful for other researchers in this regard and make a contribution to the further development of the platform.

Ki, Junhyung

Random Stuff
============

Here is some text explaining some very complicated stuff.::

	print 'hello'
	>> hello

Open this :download:`example <_images/GSoC_image.png>` input file to see the following result:

Making links
============

It is easy to make a link to `yahoo <http://yahoo.com>`_

For example, see the module :mod:`matplotlib.backend_bases` documentation, or the
class :class:`~matplotlib.backend_bases.LocationEvent`, or the method
:meth:`~matplotlib.backend_bases.FigureCanvasBase.mpl_connect`.
